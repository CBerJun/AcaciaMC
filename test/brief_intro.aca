#*
 * General test file for Acacia
 * This file gives you a brief picture of Acacia,
 * while itself is a legal Acacia program.
 *
 * Compile this with:
 *   cd path/to/acacia
 *   python3 main.py -d test/brief_intro.aca
 * "-d" is to show the debugging comments in output files
 * Any Python 3 environment could interpret this, since Acacia
 * does not require any third-party modules.
 *#

# Fancy number & Constant folding
# Following `+` and `and` operator should be calculated during compile time
x = 10
x = 0XF2e + 0b11 # Referring to hexadecimal 3886 and binary 3
y = True and False

# Fancy operators
i2 = (x % -2) * (x + 3)

# Macro defining (aka. Binding)
scoreboard -> "scb"
# The following occurances of `scoreboard` are replaced with `"scb"`
player -> "@a[tag=player]"

# Control statements
## If statement
if x > 5:
    x *= 2
# `x` will be doubled only when it's larger than 5
## While statement
sum = 0
while x > 0:
    sum += x
    x -= 1
# Sum up numbers from 1 to `x`
# IMPORTANT NOTICE: Loops are implemented through recursion, which runs
# a lot of commands. Minecraft limits the amount of commands that one
# function could trigger to 10000. Be careful when using loops.

# Compatible with the original command system
## Accessing scoreboards
# "|" selector ":" objective "|" is referring to selector's score on objective
x = |"@p": "score"| + 10
|"CBerJun": scoreboard| = 3
x = |player: "data"|

## Accessing Raw Command
/say Hello, world!
# Using macros with commands
/tp ${player} 11 45 14
/scoreboard players add ${player} ${scoreboard} 10
/*
tellraw @a {"rawtext":[
    {"text": "Hello "},
    {"text": "world!"}
]}
*/

# Great builtin modules!
# The builtin modules are actually seperated from the compiler itself,
# which means: everyone can create their own Acacia module!
# These builtin modules are written in Python at acaciamc/modules
import print
# Tell every players "Hello world!"
print.tell("Hello world!", "@a")
# Show title "Chapter I" on the nearest player's screen, for 10 seconds
print.title("Chapter I", "@p", stay_time=200)
# Show everyone the value of `x` in the form of "Value of X: ..." above actionbar
print.title(print.format("Value of X: %0", x), mode=print.ACTIONBAR)
# Another builtin module is `math`. See test/module.aca
# Not only these modules written in Python are supported, Acacia code
# can be imported by other Acacia programs. See test/module.aca

# Function definition
# Type of argument or its default value must be specified
def max(a: int, b = int.MAX) -> int:
                    # int.MAX is referring to 2147483647
    #* Return the larger one between a and b *#
    if a >= b:
        result a
        # Unlike "return" in modern languages like Python,
        # result statements do not stop functions!
    else:
        result b

def is_larger(a: int, b: int) -> bool:
    #* Return whether a is larger than b *#
    result a > b

if not is_larger(x, 4):
    x = 2
# Comments and empty lines does not affect parsing an indented block
    i2 = 1 + max(x, i2)
# This Elif statement is optimized (1 < 10 is always True)
elif 1 < 10:
    x = 100
else:
    pass # Empty block

# Exported interface
# These interfaces are exported for later use in Minecraft
interface a:
    # local variables are unreachable outside scope
    local = 20 < x <= 100 and (i2 > 4 or x <= 5)
    if local and (8 > x + 1 > 5):
        x = 2
# Now we can use the `a` interface in Minecraft through /function
# command (when using default compile options, it is stored at
# acacia/interface/a.mcfunction)
# A useless interface is automatically deleted
interface b:
    if False:
        x = 3

# Line continuation using backslash
x = \
    10 + int(y)
    # convert bool to int, also referring to the builtin integer type

# That's all~
# Enjoy this project :)
